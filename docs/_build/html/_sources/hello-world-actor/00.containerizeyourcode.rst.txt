Create a Custom Actor
=====================

This guide will demonstrate how to create a custom actor from scratch.

In this example, we will build a simple hello-world actor that says "Hello, World!".



Components of an Actor
----------------------

Make a new directory and add the following files:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mkdir hello-world-actor/ && cd hello-world-actor/

   $ touch Dockerfile requirements.txt actor.py

   $ tree ../hello-world-actor/
   hello-world-actor/
   ├── Dockerfile
   ├── requirements.txt
   └── actor.py

   0 directories, 3 files


Write the Actor Function
------------------------

The ``actor.py`` python script is where the code for your main function can
be found. An example of a functional actor that says "Hello, World!" is:

.. code-block:: python

   """Say Hello, World or the message received from user input"""
   from agavepy.actors import get_context

   # function to print the message
   def say_hello_world(m):
   """Print message from user if present, else echo "Hello, World"""
      if m == " ":
          print("Actor says: Hello, World")
      else:
          print("Actor received message: {}".format(m))

  def main():
  """Main entry to grab message context from user input"""
      context = get_context()
      message = context['raw_message']
      say_hello_world(message)

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()


This code makes use of the **agavepy** python library which we will install in
the Docker container. The library includes an "actors" object which is useful to
grab the message and other context from the environment. And, it can be used to
interact with other parts of the Tapis platform. Add the above code to your
``actor.py`` file.


Define Environment Variables
----------------------------

The ``environment.json`` file may contain useful environment variables or
configurations to pass to the actor at creation time. These variables will be
part of the "context" taken from the environment, as in the example python
script above. For the purposes of this example, add the following definition to
``environment.json``:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "foo": "bar"
   }


Create a Dockerfile
-------------------

The only requirements are python and the agavepy python library, which is
available through
`PyPi <https://pypi.org/>`_.
A bare-bones Dockerfile needs to satisfy those dependencies, add the actor
python script, and set a default command to run the actor python script. Add
the following lines to your ``Dockerfile``:

.. code-block:: bash

   # pull base image
   FROM python:3.6

   # add requirements.txt to docker container
   ADD requirements.txt /requirements.txt

   # install requirements.txt
   RUN pip3 install -r /requirements.txt

   # add the python script to docker container
   ADD actor.py /actor.py

   # command to run the python script
   CMD ["python", "/actor.py"]

.. tip::

   Creating small Docker images is important for maintaining actor speed and
   efficiency

Build and Push the Dockerfile
-----------------------------

The Docker image must be pushed to a public repository in order for the actor
to use it. Use the following Docker commands in your local actor folder to build
and push to a repository that you have access to:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Build and tag the image
   $ docker build -t taccuser/hello-world:1.0 .
   Sending build context to Docker daemon  4.096kB
   Step 1/5 : FROM python:3.7-slim
   ...
   Successfully built b0a76425e8b3
   Successfully tagged taccuser/hello-world:1.0

   # Push the tagged image to Docker Hub
   $ docker push taccuser/hello-world:1.0
   The push refers to repository [docker.io/taccuser/word-count]
   ...
