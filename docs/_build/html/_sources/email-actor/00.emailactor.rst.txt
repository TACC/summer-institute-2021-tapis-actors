Send Email Message From Actor
-----------------------------

The function of an actor is exposed as the default command in a Docker
container. Here, we will create an actor from an existing Docker container image
called **tacc/email-actor:latest** available on
`Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tacc/email-actor>`__.
The default command for this container emails the message "Hello, World" or
the message sent to it, which will be captured in the actor logs.

Create the actor as:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ tapis actors create --repo tacc/email-actor:latest \
                         -n email-actor \
                         -d "Test actor that emails Hello, World"
    +----------------+----------------------------+
    | Field          | Value                      |
    +----------------+----------------------------+
    | id             | w66kex1yD7Ql               |
    | name           | email-actor                |
    | owner          | sgopal                     |
    | image          | reshg/email-actor:latest   |
    | lastUpdateTime | 2021-08-24T14:31:58.248860 |
    | status         | SUBMITTED                  |
    +----------------+----------------------------+

The ``--repo`` flag points to the Docker Hub repo on which this actor is based,
the ``-n`` flag and ``-d`` flag attach a human-readable name and description to
the actor.

The resulting actor is assigned an id: ``w66kex1yD7Ql``. The actor id can be
queried by:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ tapis actors show -v w66kex1yD7Ql
   {
      "id": "w66kex1yD7Ql",
      "name": "email-actor",
      "description": "Actor that emails the message",
      "owner": "taccuser",
      "image": "tacc/email-actor:latest",
      "createTime": "2021-08-24T14:31:58.248Z",
      "lastUpdateTime": "2021-08-24T14:31:58.248Z",
      "defaultEnvironment": {},
      "gid": 862347,
      "hints": [],
      "link": "",
      "mounts": [
       {
          "container_path": "/work",
          "host_path": "/work",
          "mode": "rw"
       },
       {
        "container_path": "/corral",
        "host_path": "/corral-repl/projects/SD2E-Community",
        "mode": "rw"
       }
      ],
      "privileged": false,
      "queue": "default",
      "stateless": true,
      "status": "READY",
      "statusMessage": " ",
      "token": true,
      "uid": 862347,
      "useContainerUid": false,
      "webhook": "",
      "_links": {
        "executions": "https://api.sd2e.org/actors/v2/w66kex1yD7Ql/executions",
        "owner": "https://api.sd2e.org/profiles/v2/sgopal",
        "self": "https://api.sd2e.org/actors/v2/w66kex1yD7Ql"
      }
  }



Above, you can see the plain text name, description that were passed on the command line. In addition, you can see the
"status" of the actor is "READY", meaning it is ready to receive and act on
messages. Finally, you can list all actors visible to you with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ tapis actors list
   +---------------+---------------+----------+-----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-------+
   | id            | name          | owner    | image                       | lastUpdateTime             | status | cronOn|
   +---------------+---------------+----------+-----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-------+
   | w66kex1yD7Ql  | email-actor   | taccuser | tacc/email-actor:latest     | 2021-08-14T22:25:06.171Z   | READY  | False |
   +---------------+---------------+----------+-----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-------+


Submit a Message to the Actor
-----------------------------

Next, let's craft a simple message to send to the reactor. Messages can be plain
text or in JSON format. When using the python actor libraries as in the example
above, JSON-formatted messages are made available as python dictionaries.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Write a message
   $ export MESSAGE='Hello, World'
   $ echo $MESSAGE
   Hello, World

   $ Submit the message to the actor
   $ tapis actors submit -m "$MESSAGE" w66kex1yD7Ql
   +-------------+---------------+
   |  Field      | Value         |
   +-------------+---------------+
   | executionId | w1plap4NalAWb |
   | msg         | Hello, World  |
   +-------------+---------------+

The id of the actor (``N4xQ5WM5Np1X0``) was used on the command line to specify
which actor should receive the message. In response, an "execution id"
(``N4xQ5WM5Np1X0``) is returned. An execution is a specific instance of an actor.
List all the executions for a given actor as:

.. code-block::bash

   $ tapis actors execs list w1plap4NalAWb
   +---------------+----------+
   | executionId   | status   |
   +---------------+----------+
   | w1plap4NalAWb | COMPLETE |
   +---------------+----------+

The above execution has already completed. Show detailed information for the
execution with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ tapis actors execs show -v w66kex1yD7Ql w1plap4NalAWb
   {
      "actorId": "w66kex1yD7Ql",
      "apiServer": "https://api.sd2e.org",
      "cpu": 559911564,
      "exitCode": 0,
      "finalState": {
          "Dead": false,
          "Error": "",
          "ExitCode": 0,
          "FinishedAt": "2021-08-24T14:33:48.879Z",
          "OOMKilled": false,
          "Paused": false,
          "Pid": 0,
          "Restarting": false,
          "Running": false,
          "StartedAt": "2021-08-24T14:33:47.049Z",
          "Status": "exited"
      },
      "id": "w1plap4NalAWb",
      "io": 7349,
      "messageReceivedTime": "2021-08-24T14:33:45.714Z",
      "runtime": 2,
      "startTime": "2021-08-24T14:33:46.565Z",
      "status": "COMPLETE",
      "workerId": "E6LW3MrpyAOa",
      "_links": {
          "logs": "https://api.sd2e.org/actors/v2/w66kex1yD7Ql/executions/w1plap4NalAWb/logs",
          "owner": "https://api.sd2e.org/profiles/v2/sgopal",
          "self": "https://api.sd2e.org/actors/v2/w66kex1yD7Ql/executions/w1plap4NalAWb"
      }
  }



Check the Logs for an Execution
-------------------------------

An execution's logs will contain whatever was printed to STDOUT / STDERR by the
actor. In our demo actor, we just expect the actor to print the message passed to it.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ tapis actors execs logs w66kex1yD7Ql w1plap4NalAWb
   Logs for execution w1plap4NalAWb
    Actor received message: Hello, World
    Message emailed successfully!


In a normal scenario, the actor would then act on the contents of a message to, e.g.,
kick off a job, perform some data management, send messages to other actors, or
more.


Run Synchronously
-----------------

The previous message submission (with ``tapis actors submit``) was an
*asynchronous* run, meaning the command prompt detached from the process after
it was submitted to the actor. In that case, it was up to us to check the execution
to see if it had completed and manually print the logs.

There is also a mode to run actors *synchronously* using ``tapis actors run``,
meaning the command line stays attached to the process awaiting a response after
sending a message to the actor. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ tapis actors run -m "$MESSAGE" w66kex1yD7Ql
   FULL CONTEXT:
   {
     "username": "taccuser",
     "HOSTNAME": "33d4dd334ef9",
     "_abaco_worker_id": "X5xGkZ0lol0D3",
     "raw_message": "{\"key1\":\"value1\", \"key2\":\"value2\"}",
     "actor_dbid": "TACC-PROD_boEg3mEvrKO5w",
     "_abaco_container_repo": "jturcino/abaco-trial:latest",
     "content_type": null,
     "PATH": "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
     "MSG": "{\"key1\":\"value1\", \"key2\":\"value2\"}",
     "HOME": "/",
     "_abaco_actor_state": "{}",
     "_abaco_actor_name": "example-actor",
     "_abaco_Content_Type": "str",
     "execution_id": "jP3RExQW108wM",
     "_abaco_synchronous": "True",
     "_abaco_access_token": "de6d11bdbb5a16bdd85beec692b1b283",
     "_abaco_api_server": "https://api.tacc.utexas.edu",
     "_abaco_actor_dbid": "TACC-PROD_boEg3mEvrKO5w",
     "_abaco_jwt_header_name": "X-Jwt-Assertion-Tacc-Prod",
     "_abaco_actor_id": "NN5N0kGDvZQpA",
     "_abaco_execution_id": "jP3RExQW108wM",
     "state": "{}",
     "_abaco_username": "taccuser",
     "actor_id": "NN5N0kGDvZQpA"
   }
   ...

The output above is truncated because it is mostly the same response as our
first execution of the actor. This time, however, we did not need to query the
logs for this execution for them to print to screen - that was done
automatically.
