Slackbot Actor
==============

In this section, let us create an actor that sends a message to a Slack Channel via webhook.
Customize the channel, apparent username, and of course, the text message. You provide the Slack webhook!

Build and deploy
----------------

Configure a Slack webhook or request one from your organization.

The Webbook
-----------

How do we get the webhook into our Actor? We don't. Instead of embedding it in the underlying container, it is defined as an environment variable in
the Actor. We must set ``SLACK_WEBHOOK`` while creating the actor. This can be done using Tapis CLI.
In the ``tapis actors create`` command, we can pass it as an environment variables via the -e flag.


Write the Actor Function
------------------------

An example of a functional actor that says sends a slack message is:

.. code-block:: python

   # actor.py
   """Forward message from Actor inbox to Slack"""

   from agavepy.actors import get_context
   import requests
   import os
   import simplejson as json


   def post_to_slack(message: str):
      """Forward string type `message` to Slack channel"""

      webhook_url = os.environ.get('SLACK_WEBHOOK')
      print("Actor sending message to Slack: {0}".format(message))

      payload = {
          'text': message,
          'channel': "#2021_crt_tapis",
          'username': "tapis_actors"
      }

      try:
         requests.post(webhook_url, data=json.dumps(payload), 
                       headers={"Content-type": "application/json"})
      except Exception as ex:
         print("Exception occured", ex)
         raise


   def main():
      """Main entrypoint"""
      context = get_context()
      message = context['raw_message']
      post_to_slack(message)


  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

Here inject the necessary environment variable ``SLACK_WEBHOOK`` set from ``tapis actors create`` command.
The ``agavepy`` library includes an "actors" object which is useful to grab the message and other context from the environment.

Writing Customized Actors
--------------------

Recall that Tapis Actors are essentially bits of code wrapped in lightweight environments called containers. 
When we deployed the ``hello-world`` Actor in the previous section, we used a pre-built Docker container (``tacc/hello-world:1.0``). 
However, a more common use case is to write custom code that runs whenever the Actor executes. To do this, we must first build a
Docker image using our custom ``actor.py``, push the Docker image to a public image registry (DockerHub), and instruct Tapis to
use our custom image when executing the container. 

If you are interested in learning more about Docker containers, please attend our deep dive Docker container session tomorrow (Friday Sept. 24th), where we
will cover custom image creation, common use cases, and more.


Write the Dockerfile
--------------------

The first step to building our customized Actor is to build a customized Docker image. To do this, we write a Dockerfile, which is 
a list of instructions for building our customized environment. The below Dockerfile constructs an image containing a Python3 runtime
environment, Python package dependencies installed by pip, and our ``actor.py`` script. 
The pip-installed requirements are agavepy, requests
simplejson python libraries, which are
available through
`PyPi <https://pypi.org/>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

   # pull base image, which provides a Python3 runtime
   FROM python:3.6

   # install package dependencies using pip
   RUN pip3 install agavepy simplejson requests

   # add our custom Python script 
   ADD actor.py /actor.py

   # command to run the python script
   CMD ["python", "/actor.py"]


.. note::

   In the below command, make sure to replace ``taccuser`` with your DockerHub username.

Build Docker Container
----------------------

Let us build and push our docker image

.. code-block:: bash

   # Build and tag the image
   $ docker build -t taccuser/slackbot-actor:1.1 .
   Sending build context to Docker daemon  4.096kB
   Step 1/5 : FROM python:3.6
   ...
   Successfully built b0a76425e8b3
   Successfully tagged taccuser/slackbot-actor:1.1

   # Push the tagged image to Docker Hub
   $ docker push taccuser/slackbot-actor:1.1
   The push refers to repository [docker.io/taccuser/slackbot-actor]
   ...
   1.1: digest: sha256:67cc6f6f00589d9ae83b99d779e4893a25e103d07e4f660c14d9a0ee06a9ddaf size: 1995


Create the Actor
----------------

We pass the ``SLACK_WEBHOOK`` as an environment variable during the time of actor creation.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export SLACK_WEBHOOK='https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXsecretXtokenXXX'
   $ tapis actors create --repo taccuser/slackbot-actor:1.1 \
                         -n slackbot-actor \
                         -d "Send a message containing text to Slack channel" \
                         -e SLACK_WEBHOOK="$SLACK_WEBHOOK"


   +----------------+----------------------------+
   | Field          | Value                      |
   +----------------+----------------------------+
   | id             | ww15Ex5oLxJ6b              |
   | name           | slackbot-actor             |
   | owner          | taccuser                   |
   | image          | taccuser/slackbot-actor:1.1|
   | lastUpdateTime | 2021-08-24T14:31:58.248860 |
   | status         | SUBMITTED                  |
   +----------------+----------------------------+



.. code-block:: bash

   $ tapis actors show ww15Ex5oLxJ6b
    {}


Above, you can see the plain text name, description, defaultEnvironment that were passed on the command line.
In addition, you can see the "status" of the actor is "READY", meaning it is ready to receive and act on
messages.

Finally, you can list all actors visible to you with:


.. code-block:: bash

   $ tapis actors list

   +---------------+---------------+----------+-----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+
   | ww15Ex5oLxJ6b | slackbot-actor| taccuser | taccuser/slackbot-actor:1.1 | 2021-08-25T14:04:42.819Z   | READY  |
   +---------------+---------------+----------+-----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+


Submit a Message to the Actor
-----------------------------


.. code-block:: bash

   # Write a message
   $ export MESSAGE='Hello, Slack!'
   $ echo $MESSAGE
   Hello, Slack!

   # Submit the message to the actor
   $ tapis actors submit -m "$MESSAGE" ww15Ex5oLxJ6b
   +-------------+---------------+
   |  Field      | Value         |
   +-------------+---------------+
   | executionId | EjO6yw03GKRmR |
   | msg         | Hello, Slack  |
   +-------------+---------------+

Let us grab the executionId from here to track the progress of the actor.

List Executions of Actor
------------------------

.. code-block::bash

      $ tapis actors execs list ww15Ex5oLxJ6b
      +---------------+----------+
      | executionId   | status   |
      +---------------+----------+
      | EjO6yw03GKRmR | COMPLETE |
      +---------------+----------+


The above execution has already completed. Show detailed information for the
execution with:


.. code-block:: bash

   $ tapis actors execs show -v ww15Ex5oLxJ6b EjO6yw03GKRmR

   {
      "actorId": "ww15Ex5oLxJ6b",
      "apiServer": "https://api.sd2e.org",

       }
   }


Check the Logs for an Execution
-------------------------------

In our slackbot-actor, we expect the actor to print the message passed to it and notify on the slack channel.


.. code-block:: bash

   $ tapis actors execs logs ww15Ex5oLxJ6b EjO6yw03GKRmR
   Logs for execution EjO6yw03GKRmR
    Actor sending message to Slack: Hello, Slack!

Finally check your Slack channel to find your message!
