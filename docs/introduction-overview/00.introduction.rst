Introduction to Actors
======================

In Tapis, **actors** are container-based functions-as-a-service that follow the
actor model of concurrent computation. An actor responds to messages it receives
by changing its state, performing an action, sending out response messages, or
all of the above.

The function an actor performs is exposed as the default command in a container.
It is typically quick and requires little processing power - i.e. an app may be
configured to
`run FastQC <../advanced-api/create_a_custom_app.html>`__,
and an actor may trigger a job using that app.

The guide below is a brief introduction to interacting with actors on the Tapis
platform. For a full reference guide to actors, see the
`Abaco Documentation <https://tacc-cloud.readthedocs.io/projects/abaco/en/latest/index.html>`_.
