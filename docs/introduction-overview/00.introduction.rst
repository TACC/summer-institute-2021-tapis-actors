Introduction to Actors
======================

The Tapis Actors API lets you deploy code written in any language to 
implement functions or services. 

Examples include:
    - Process a file upload
    - Send an email
    - Perform ETL on data
    - Coordinate a workflow
    - `Your use case here`

Tapis Actors are a form of *serverless computing* like AWS Lambda, 
Firebase Functions, or OpenFaas, but are tailored to support the 
needs of research computing. 

Tapis Actors help you:
    - Avoid lockin
        - Built as Docker containers
        - Underlying platform is free and open-source
    - Deploy any code
        - Write new function code in any language
        - Bring in legacy software and binaries
    - Run at any scale
        - Automatically scale up when needed
        - Scale to zero when not

Tapis Actors can run standalone, be composed into complex workflows, 
or integrated with external third-party platforms. They serve as 
connecting threads amongst the complex systems in our commercial and 
research computing ecosystems.
