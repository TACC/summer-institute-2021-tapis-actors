What is an Actor?
=================

For our purposes, an *Actor* is a container-based function-as-a-service deployed 
on a software platform called Abaco, where it will follow the `actor model` of 
concurrent computation.

In response to a message it receives, an Actor can
    - Make local decisions
    - Create more actors
    - Send more messages
    - Determine how to respond to the next message received.

Actors may modify their own private state, but can only affect each 
other indirectly through messaging. The *actor model* is characterized 
by concurrency of computation within and among actors, dynamic 
actor creation, requirement for actor addresses in messages, and 
interaction only through direct message passing.

In the Tapis Actors implementation, each actor registered in the system is 
associated with a Docker image. Actor containers are executed in response to 
messages posted to their inbox, which itself is given by a URI exposed via the 
system. In the process of executing each actor container state, logs and 
execution statistics are collected. 

Typically, functions performed by actors are quick and require little processing power. 
Use cases with more substantial run times or resource requirements are usually 
best addressed using Tapis Apps.
